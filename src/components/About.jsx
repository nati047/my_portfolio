          Hello, I'm Natnael Tekletsadik (friends call me Nat). I am a junior Full-stack web developer. I love turning well crafted code into beautiful and useful apps. Coding has tranformed me from just admiring technology to also become a creator. For this reason I decided to do what I enjoy everyday and I studied full-stack web development. Right now I'm looking for fulltime web developer positions. 
          When i'm not infront of my screen, I enjoy watching and playing soccer. 
           If you want to have a conversation I'm a text away. Enjoy checking out my projects!
